                                    health benefits by taking short walks of ten to fifteen minutes, spread throughout the day, instead of waiting to have a long stretch of 30 minutes or more. <strong>Short walks can be built into the busiest of daily routines</strong>.

    <h2>PREVENT FOOT CRAMPS</h2>
     <P>I get agonizing cramps in my feet when I exercise . Are there any stretches or exercises that you would recommend for this problem?<br />
        Doctors response;<br />
	   depends on what the cause of the cramping is. I recommend
that you check with your doctor if the exercises I suggest do
not help and the problem persists.</p>
  <p>Here are stretches for your calves and your feet. Hold each
stretch until your muscles feel looser and repeat two to three
times with each leg. Do these every day.<br />
Calf Stretch (gastrocnemius muscle)</p>
